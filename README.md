This repository has the code for my "Average Weight App" that is hosted <a href="https://porschia.shinyapps.io/AvgWeight">here</a>. 
The include.md file has the documentation for the application. I attempted to add the documentation to a tab in UI.R but I am 
currently waiting for shiny.io to recognize the latest update to RStudio so I can deploy my updated application.
