## Documentation for Shiny App  
This application uses the "women" dataset from the basic datasets that come with RStudio. It uses the height of US women to calculate the average weight of US women from the dataset. You can use the slider bar to select the height. The heights are calculated in inches and the weights are calculated in pounds.
